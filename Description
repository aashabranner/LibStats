#Description: This package contains a fabricated time series data set from a fabricated university's academic library.
#The data is composed of various library services and their user counts, as well as an overall enrollment count
#of the university. The intention here is to show trends over time, compared to an overall user population. This package attempts
#to portray the type of data that libraries collect and the methods by which to analyze it. Statistical methods used align with
#methods found in the social sciences. The package is by no means all-inclusive, it is merely suggestive of the types of data that
#are collected and how they function to inform information professionals.
